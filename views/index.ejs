          <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in
          American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular
          gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>

          <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
          people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
          pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing.</p>

          <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
          don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow
          it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem.
